    <h1>Spaghetti alla Carbonara</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its
      signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot
      pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot
      enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle.
