    <h1>Pepperoni Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza.jpg" alt="image of a pizza" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Even though this pizza is low-carb and keto-friendly, the whole family
      will devour it! It's also made without cream cheese! You can switch out
      the toppings for whatever you prefer. Note that the yeast is added solely
      for bread-like flavor in this recipe and not as a raising agent, since
      there is no sugar present to activate the yeast. Use your favorite
      no-sugar-added pizza sauce or marinara sauce. I highly recommend shredding
      your own mozzarella as the bagged variety doesn't melt well.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons yeast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons warm water</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup no sugar added pizza sauce</li>
      <li>2 ounces sliced pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix yeast into warm water in a small cup, stirring to dissolve. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese into a medium microwave-safe bowl.
        Microwave for 90 seconds, stirring every 30 seconds until completely
        melted. Stir in the yeast mixture and egg; stir to combine. The mixture
        will not incorporate well at this point.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in almond flour, xanthan gum, and salt. If difficult to mix, reheat
        in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to soften the cheese. Stir again
        until well incorporated. Knead dough by hand for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place dough on the prepared baking sheet and press with your fingers
        into a thin crust 11 to 12 inches in diameter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
        Spread pizza sauce over pizza. Top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella
        cheese, then scatter pepperoni on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes
        more. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Cut into 6 slices.
      </li>
    </ol>
